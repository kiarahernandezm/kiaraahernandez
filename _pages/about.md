I am a Ph.D Candidate in the Department of Government at Harvard University. I completed my B.A. in Political Science and History at the University of Michigan. Prior to starting at Harvard, I worked as a Research Analyst at YouGov in San Francisco, California. 

My research sits the intersection of international & comparative political economy and political psychology and behavior. My dissertation project investigates how publics, governments, and firms imagine, evaluate, and construct nationality for multinational corporations, and the effects of corporate nationality on policymaking, regulatory outcomes, and corporate lobbying behavior.

I am affiliated with the Institute for Quantitative Social Science (IQSS) and the Center for American Political Studies (CAPS). I am also a Senior Lab Manager at Harvardâ€™s Digital Lab for the Social Sciences (DLABSS).

In my spare time, I enjoy photography, playing guitar, studying chess, and agonizing over Michigan athletics.
