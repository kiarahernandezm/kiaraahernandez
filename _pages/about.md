I am a Ph.D. candidate in Government at Harvard University and a James M. and Cathleen D. Stone PhD Scholar in Inequality and Wealth Concentration at the Harvard Kennedy School. 

I study American politics with a focus on political behavior, political psychology, and the politics of inequality. My research examines how economic inequality and diversity shape intergroup relations, collective action, and support for redistributive social and fiscal policies. My dissertation uses workplace contact and the unionization process as a case study to examine the dynamics of intergroup cooperation, identifying when and why diversity shapes collective action in the primarily low-wage service sector workplaces.

My research is generously supported by the Russell Sage Foundation, the Stone PhD Scholar Fellowship, the American Political Science Association Diversity Fellowship Program, and the GSAS Prize Fellowship. I am an affiliate of the Center for American Political Studies and the Institute for Quantitative Social Science, and a Graduate Student Researcher with The Shift Project. I was formerly the graduate student coordinator of the Working Group in Political Psychology and Behavior.

I graduated with a B.A. in International Relations and German from the University of Pennsylvania. Before beginning my Ph.D., I spent two years as a predoctoral research specialist in the Emerging Scholars in Political Science program at Princeton University, where I contributed to research on public opinion, voter turnout, and racialized campaign messaging in American elections. 

I spent my childhood in California, Germany, and, primarily, the suburbs of Houston, TX. I am the proud product of K-12 public schools and a third-generation Mexican American. Outside of the PhD, I enjoy running, playing tennis, and am trying to finally learn French.
