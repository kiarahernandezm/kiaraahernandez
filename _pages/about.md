I am a Ph.D. candidate in Government at Harvard University and a James M. and Cathleen D. Stone PhD Scholar in Inequality and Wealth Concentration at the Harvard Kennedy School. My research interests are in political psychology and political behavior. Within these fields, I am primarily interested in the effects of macro-level economic transformations, economic inequality, and demographic change on intergroup relations and political attitudes in the U.S.

My research is generously supported by the Russell Sage Foundation, the Stone PhD Scholar Fellowship, the American Political Science Association Diversity Fellowship Program, and the GSAS Prize Fellowship. I am an affiliate of the Center for American Political Studies and the Institute for Quantitative Social Science, and a Graduate Student Researcher with The Shift Project. I was formerly the graduate student coordinator of the Working Group in Political Psychology and Behavior.

I spent my childhood in California, Germany, and, primarily, the suburbs of Houston, TX. I am the proud product of K-12 public schools and a third-generation Mexican American. Outside of the PhD, I enjoy running, playing tennis, and am trying to finally learn French.
