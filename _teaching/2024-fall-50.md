In Fall Semester 2024, I taught two sections of the Government Department's undergraduate Data Science course for Professor Libby Jenke.

Below are a collection of anonymous teaching evaluations from my students in this course. 

1. *"Ethan is an incredible TF and really cares about his students, their interests, and what they learn. He made sure to make time outside of class to help me with my project, even spending hours helping fix my code. He is an awesome TF and really helped me learn in this course."*


2. *"Ethan Miles is an excellent TF, and I am very fortunate to have had him as my section lead. He is enthusiastic and patient. He enjoys teaching and sharing his enthusiasm for all things data. He is very encouraging and puts a lot of effort into assisting his students. He will certainly go the extra mile for you."*


3. *"10/10 Instructor!! He wasn't even my assigned TF, but his teaching was so good, I started doing well on the PSETS, actually understanding course content, and even went to class on a Friday because his teaching was that engaging, it barely felt like work. WELL DONE ETHAN!"*
